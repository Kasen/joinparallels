Hiring manager: [Konstantin Nazarov](https://github.com/racktear)


Parallels infrastructure team provides product teams with a reliable platform and automated pipeline to roll out and execute application code. As members of this team we aim to build knowledge base about systems operations and share that knowledge in executable and reusable forms.
We already have implemented lots of building blocks on the road to modern infrastructure: configuration management, environment testing, development in vagrant, automated code deployment, and more. Now we need to take it a step further and increase the scale at which we operate.

## Your first year goal ##

Build an API around multi-datacenter installation of Virtuozzo hypervisor. The API should be able to allocate and destroy compute instances (VMs and containers), provide an overview of resource utilisation and decide automatically where new instances should be created.
During the implementation of this system you will also need to build a Terraform driver around that API, and work on linking this layer to automated environment rollout.

Another part of your daily responsibilities will be maintaining shared Chef cookbook set along with other members of the team.

## Desired qualifications ##

This position in general requires a software development background, as you are expected to design and build a multi-component system that is reliable and well-tested. But if you come from other background, here's a skill set you should match:

- Good knowledge of a high-level mainstream language (preferred: Python, Ruby, Go, Java)
- Knowledge of linux userspace: filesystem, shell, processes/threads, IPC
- Ability to troubleshoot malfunctioning services, e.g. what state the application is in, why it has been killed, etc...
- Basic knowledge of network subsystem
- Ability to test your own code
